# Shakespeare_insult
Shakespeare insult generator, because why not. 
DISCLAIMER:

This is a script I wrote for the fun of it, based off of a facebook post. I don't know what many of these words mean, so please don't take any of these insults personally. If they offend you for any reason, I'm sorry. You can always generate a new one. 

You need to have the python file, and all three text files in the same folder. Run the script with "python Shakespeare_insult.py". requires python 2.7
